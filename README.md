### Tree task

Find and delete (if there is such a vertex, by right deleting) the maximum value among the vertices for which the distance to any other tree vertex is strictly less than `k` and through which semipaths of length `k` do not pass (the semipath length and the distance between two vertices are measured by the number of arcs).

###### Solution - tree_task.cpp
